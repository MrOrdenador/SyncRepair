# SyncRepair

Ever wondered when the perfect time is to repair your armor for maximum XP efficiency?

**SyncRepair** helps you optimize your armor repairs by checking the damage across all your Mending armor pieces and telling you exactly when to start mending.

The mod features an integrated Armor HUD. It’s highly customizable and easy to configure.  
Note: The positions are a bit odd, I know. It bugged a lot, so I left it that way.

### What this mod does:
- Calculates how many XP bottles are needed to repair everything to the "cap"  
  (cap = the durability of the armor piece with the lowest maximum durability).
- Shows how damaged your armor is using color-coded text.
- Tells you when to start mending to use exactly "X" XP bottles (configurable, default: 64).

Here you can check if this mod is allowed in the main tierlists that use XP bottles:

|                   | **[McTiers](https://mctiers.com/)** | **[PvPTiers](https://pvptiers.com/)** | **[SubTiers](https://subtiers.net/)** |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **SMP/DiaSMP**     | Allowed     | Allowed      | Allowed      |
| **NethPot**        | NOT Allowed **in tests** | NOT Allowed **in tests**            | –            |
| **CPvP/DiaCPvP**   | ?           | ?            | Allowed            |
| **Mace**           | –           | ?            | –            |

If your gamemode isn’t listed in the table above, I recommend asking the staff or checking the rules channel.

Personally, I believe this mod works better in Not-RNG based XP bottles environments. I like both McTiers and PvPTiers, but it's fair to say it's more useful in the McTiers environment
